var Joshua2="Some time later, Leonhardt and Joshua encountered Georg Weissmann who offered to fix Joshua's broken heart in exchange for them joining Ouroboros.

It devastated his mother mentally and physically, and Kevin knew that his attempts to cheer her up were completely futile. On one winter's day, he woke up when his mother was trying to strangle him.

var Llyod1="Born in S.1186, <strong>Lloyd Bannings</strong> lost his parents to an accident at the age of 3. From that moment onward, his brother Guy Bannings, a renowned and respected investigator for the Crossbell Police Department's First Division, became his most important role model. Guy's death in S.1201 struck him hard, which forced Lloyd to move in with his uncle in Calvard. Determined to succeed his brother, he signed up for the Police Academy in Crossbell and graduated in S.1203.

On behalf of Cao Lee, Lloyd and Rixia Mao were tasked with backing up data from Orbal Network terminals in the Geofront. During the operation, Lloyd was confronted by Altina Orion and Rean Schwarzer, the latter of which was working as a special military officer of Crossbell's General Government.

After formally introducing themselves, Rean allowed Lloyd to escape with the data.";
var Wazy1="Born in an unnamed place at the outskirts of Zemuria, <strong>Wazy Hemisphere</strong> grew up in a village in which contact with the outside world was prohibited and where an ancient deity other than Aidios was worshiped. As a child, Wazy served the village as a medium able to hear the voice of the local deity.</br> One day, villagers one after the other fell into a deep torpor for no explicable reason. Upon investigation, Wazy found that the local deity was rampaging and absorbing the energy flowing through the earth veins. Rather than taking his suggestion to seal the veins into consideration, the village elders began discussing a human sacrifice to appease the deity.";
var Wazy2="At that moment, Gralsritter from the Septian Church arrived, which led Wazy to realize that the local deity was not a god but in fact a slab-like artifact. Wazy tried to destroy the artifact by throwing it off a cliff to release the village from the ancient spell the artifact had cast on it. The artifact resisted this attempt and overpowered Wazy, which led his Stigma to awaken in self-defense. His Stigma in turn absorbed the artifact's power, turning it into an ordinary lithograph that crumbled away in his hands. Wazy was then banished from the village, accused of murdering the local deity. The Gralsritter escorted the now-exiled Wazy to Arteria where he was then welcomed as one of the twelve Dominion.";
var Rean1="<strong>Rean Schwarzer</strong> is the adopted son of Teo and Lucia Schwarzer. He was found by his adoptive father just outside of Ymir, and he has no memory of his life prior to being found. Though he was raised in a loving environment, he felt an immense amount of guilt towards his foster family for being a burden. Following a traumatic incident in which he viciously murdered a beast after being overwhelmed by an unknown power, Rean began to fear himself. </br>Some time later, Yun Ka-Fai took him in as a pupil, teaching him the Eight Leaves One Blade School of swordsmanship in the hopes that Rean could eventually overcome his fear and master his power. Unfortunately, Rean was unable to do so and Yun Ka-Fai had to cut his training short.";
var Rean2="After struggling to find a path to follow in life, Rean decided to enroll at Thors Military Academy, in an attempt to distance himself from his foster family and become a soldier in the army. He was placed in Class VII (a class that didn't segregate its students based on social standing) and was sent to various locations as a part of his field studies. Shortly before the start of the Erebonian Civil War, Rean and his classmates discover Valimar, The Ashen Knight, in the depths of the Old Schoolhouse. Upon completing the final trial, Rean officially becomes the 'Ashen Awakener'. After the events of the Erebonian Civil War, Rean is recognized as the Ashen Chevalier, the hero who ended the war. He enters a depressive state due to death of Crow Armbrust and the Empire's growing dominance, but is able to snap out of it with the support of his friends and teachers at Thors. He ultimately makes the decision to serve as a military officer for the Erebonian Army despite having reservations, ultimately doing so for the greater good. </br> In truth, he is actually the son of Giliath Osborne, who abandoned him for reasons currently unknown.";
var Jusis1="Growing up as a noble, <strong> Jusis Albarea</strong> had a hard time coming to terms with having both a noble and a commoner for parents. When he finds out that Rean had similar life circumstances as well, they both accept each other and foster a supportive relationship. Jusis enrolled in Thors Military Academy in order to escape his suffocating family life. His first encounter with Machias Regnitz ended horrifically and managed to ruin his normally composed attitude. The fact that he sneers at the ridiculous nature of commoners obsessed with their hatred for nobility seems to add fuel to the fire. Over the course of his first year at Thors, he frequently irritates commoners such as Machias and Paula, who genuinely believes that he thinks he is better than them. However, this disrespectful behavior is not due to any belief that his position as a high-ranking noble makes him superior to others.";
var Jusis2="He also shows a similar disdain with other high-ranking nobleman, such as Patrick Hyarms, who attempts to recruit Jusis into his social circle. Jusis flat-out refuses Patrick, showing an open contempt at Patrick's attempts at political maneuvering within Thors. Jusis admits that he despises people who callously curry favor with him. </br> He has a haughtiness that seems typical of nobles, but is mostly to keep up appearances rather than for ill-will. Jusis shows a strong belief in the proper role of nobility. He believes that nobles have a responsibility to do right by their people, and he takes it upon himself to do everything he can to act like a proper noble. He is sometimes unsure what the right thing he should do as a noble is, but he shows dismay at many of his father's harsher policies as lord of the Kreuzen Province. For example, after the Celdic Field Study, he apologizes to Rean for the trouble his family had caused Class VII.";
